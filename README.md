# OffersApp

This React App displays the list of car rental offers that consists of Image, model, and price per day. Each offer is represented as a square div in a grid layout styled with custom CSS.

## How to start the app

Run the app in the development mode using npm start.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. 
Or open index.html in ./build folder.

## CORS 

To avoid CORS Errors you can use the "Allow CORS" browser extension, e.g. for Chrome
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf


## ToDo

1. Cover code with unit tests
2. Add spinner for data loading process
3. Add JSON object validation for the case when data is loaded, but does not contain active offers.
