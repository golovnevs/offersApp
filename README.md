# My React App for challenge.

This React App displays the list of car rental offers which consists of Image, model, and per day price. Each offer is represented as a square div in a grid layout styled with custom CSS.


## CORS 

To avoid CORS Errors I have used  Allow Cors extension for chrome

##how to start the app

Runs the app in the development mode using npm start.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. 
Or open index.html in ./build folder.


## Todos

1. Cover code with the unit tests
2. Add spinner for data loading period
3. Add checker for data object - is loaded, but does not contain offers
